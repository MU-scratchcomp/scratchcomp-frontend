<p>Warning: if you ever see something like "Confirm form resubmission?" pop up from your browser, hit cancel. You might accidentally publish feedback twice or double-count balloons if you resubmit a form. 
Just hit cancel, click in your browser's address bar and hit enter (that should refresh the page without resubmitting the form). Alternately, hit cancel and navigate back to this page (~acm/scratch/judge)
<p>All large text boxes (grading feedback, clarifications, etc.) support <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown formatting</a>.
